# thrift-distributed-systems-projects

This is a public repository hosting all the academic projects completed for `CSci 5105 : Distributed Systems` at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, *Spring 2016*.

All projects were completed using Apache Thrift, and requires Ant to build and run the projects.

As with most code hosted on GitHub, use at your own risk, refer to it if you need to, and there are bugs that exist. 

All projects were completed as a group of 2, written by [Danh Nguyen](https://github.com/dahnny012/) and I. 

Click on respective project folders for a README regarding the folders, if you do want to see the result of *college-caffeine-fuelled-last-minute-to-early-dawn-assignments* in all it's glory.
